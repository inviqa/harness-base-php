# Spryker Harness for [Workspace]

To use this harness:

1. Install [Workspace]
2. Run `ws create <projectName> inviqa/spryker:v0.10.1`
3. Fill in project-specific AWS and Github credentials, set as blank if you don't need them
4. Change to the <projectName> directory: `cd <projectName>`
5. Create an initial commit, ensuring that `workspace.override.yml` is not added to git:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
6. Store the `workspace.override.yml` contents in a suitable location (such as LastPass).

To enable jenkins service for running Spryker's background jobs, set following config in workspace.yml:
```yaml
attribute('app.services'):
  - chrome
  - postgres
  - redis
  - elasticsearch
  - rabbitmq
  - jenkins
  - jenkins-runner
```
