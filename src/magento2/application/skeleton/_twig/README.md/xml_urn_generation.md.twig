### XML URN Generation

If using PHPStorm, the Magento console application is capable of generating a URN catalog of `*.xsd` mappings which
will provide autocomplete and syntax highlighting support for the extensive XML in the Magento 2 project.

To generate the mappings, first access the console container via `ws console` and the run the following:
```
magento dev:urn-catalog:generate .idea/misc.xml
```

Afterwards, go to the `File` menu inside PHPStorm and run `Reload All from Disk`, then check an XML file, for example
`app/etc/di.xml`, which should now have working autocomplete and syntax highlighting.
