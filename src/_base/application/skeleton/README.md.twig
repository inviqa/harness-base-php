# {{ @('workspace.name') }}

Please follow the below steps to get started, if you encounter any issues installing the dependencies or provisioning the development environment, please check the [Common Issues](#common-issues) section first.

## Development Environment

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

##### General

- Access to LastPass folders
  - `Shared-{{ @('workspace.name') }}-Servers` and `Shared-{{ @('workspace.name') }}-Accounts`

##### Docker

- A working Docker setup
  - On MacOS, use [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
  - On Linux, add the official Docker repository and install the "docker-ce" package.
    You will also need to have a recent [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version - at least `1.24.0`.

#### Setup

1. Install [workspace](https://github.com/my127/workspace)
2. Copy the LastPass entry "{{ @('workspace.name') }}: Development Environment Key" to a new blank file named `workspace.override.yml` in the project root.
3. Run `ws install`

Once installed, the site should be available at [https://{{ @('hostname') }}](https://{{ @('hostname') }}).

### Development environment cleanup

To stop the development environment, run `ws disable`.

To start the development environment again, run `ws enable`.

To remove the development environment, run `ws destroy`.

### Frontend

The frontend build should be automatically done as part of bringing up the environment.

To trigger a rebuild, run `ws frontend build`.

To watch for changes, run `ws frontend watch`.

To gain access to the `console` container where the builds happen: `ws frontend console`.

{% if "mysql" in @('app.services') -%}
### MySQL Access

MySQL can be used either via command line tools via `ws db console` or via GUI tools.

In your GUI tool, set up a new connection to localhost with the port being the returned port number from:
```bash
ws port mysql
```

{% if @('database.port_forward') == "" -%}
This port will change each time the project environment is started, as docker will allocate a random unused port
on your host machine.

To set a consistent port for this project, choose a port number that you think will be unique across all projects
that your developers will encounter (e.g. not 3306!). Acceptable range of ports is 1-65535.

Once you have a port number, you can define it in the workspace.yml with:
```yaml
attribute('database.port_forward'): portNumberHere
```
{%- endif %}

The connection username and password is listed under the `mysql` service environment section in `docker-compose.yml` in
the project root.
{% endif %}

### Xdebug

Xdebug is turned off by default as it drastically slows down requests for all developers.

To enable, run `ws feature xdebug on`. To turn off again, `ws feature xdebug off`.

To enable on CLI in `ws console`, run `ws feature xdebug cli on`. To turn off again, `ws feature xdebug cli off`.

Xdebug is set up to listen to your computer's 9000 port once enabled, so all you would need to do in your IDE is:
1. Create a mapping from the project root to `/app` for name `workspace`, hostname `localhost` and port 80.
2. Listen for connections.

[Here's a good guide for PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/zero-configuration-debugging.html).

If you have trouble with triggered requests not starting connections to your IDE, check that
`sudo lsof -i :9000 | grep LISTEN` on your host shows process from your IDE.
If it doesn't, stop the indicated process (e.g. `php-fpm`) and toggle the Xdebug listen button off and on again in PhpStorm.

### Performance on MacOS

Page load times with Docker for Mac can vary considerably. This is especially so when there is a large
quantity of small files, such as with a large composer vendor folder.

{% if @('docker-sync') == 'yes' %}
[docker-sync](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/) is enabled on this workspace environment to
try to overcome this.
It enables production-like performance at the cost of having to synchronise files with an intermediate
"data" container.
{% else %}
If it takes over 2 seconds to load a page, you can consider enabling
[docker-sync](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/) which should enable production-like performance
at the cost of having to synchronise files with an intermediate "data" container.

You can enable docker-sync with `ws feature docker-sync on` - it takes a while to initially sync.
{% endif %}

If you don't like the tradeoff of having to synchronise files, you can turn docker-sync off
with `ws feature docker-sync off`.

{% if @('docker-sync') == 'yes' %}
If your page loads too slowly, you can turn docker-sync back on again  with `ws feature docker-sync on`
{% endif %}

#### Mutagen file sync

[Mutagen](https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/docker) is another tool to synchronize files between host machine
and docker containers, just like docker-sync. We have integrated mutagen for synchronizing files as an option of docker-sync.
{% if @('mutagen') == 'yes' %}
This tool is still in beta phase but we have enabled it instead of docker-sync on this project. You can switch to
docker-sync if you are not happy with mutagen.
{% else %}
This tool is still in beta phase, but you can try it yourself if you are not happy with docker-sync.
{% endif %}
Following are some useful commands regarding Mutagen.

```bash
# To switch to Mutagen file sync
ws switch mutagen
# To switch back to docker-sync
ws switch docker-sync
# To check the Mutagen sync status (sync is ready when status is "Watching for changes")
mutagen monitor
# To debug an errored sync
mutagen list
```

### Common Issues

As setup issues are encountered please detail with step by step fix instructions, and where possible update the project or the upstream workspace harness itself to provide a more permanent fix.

* If you use docker-sync and notice that your changes aren't synchronising to the environment:
  * Check if your file exists with your changes in `ws console`
  * If your file in `ws console` has changed okay, check your project for any caching that
    would prevent changes to source code appearing immediately.
  * If the file changes do not appear in `ws console` reasonably quickly, it might be that
    Docker for Mac is overwhelmed with file change events.
  * Restarting Docker for Mac using the system tray icon's menu and then running `ws enable` again
    will fix it.
