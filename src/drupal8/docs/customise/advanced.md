# Advanced customisation

There may be times when you need to customise the Workspace environment beyond what is capable via attribute overrides.  

 In these situations, if the customisation can be generalised then please look at the [contributing guide] on how to make the feature available for all projects.


## Adding a new service

If you need a service that isn't already provided (see [available base services](https://github.com/inviqa/harness-base-php/blob/0.11.x/src/_base/_twig/docker-compose.yml/service)) then you can register a new service following the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) notation.

Create your new service file in the `tools/workspace/_twig/docker-compose.yml/service/` directory.  

See the example `example.yml.twig` service file below. Note the indentation, this is deliberate and must be followed to avoid docker-compose errors.
```yaml
  example:
    image: {{ @('services.example.image') }}
    networks:
      - private
```

The `workspace.yml` file will also need to be updated to use the new service and define the new attributes used in `example.yml.twig`:
```yaml
attribute('services.example.enabled'): true
attribute('services.example.image'): "my127/example:tag"
```

## Adding Solr

Opt in to using solr with the following in your workspace.yml:
```yaml
attribute('services.solr.enabled'): true
```

If you need to use an older version than v8, set the major version like so. It is recommended to use an officially
supported version (see list of tags at [solr's docker hub page]):
```yaml
attribute('services.solr.major_version'): 7
```

This will automatically create a `collection1` solr core for use in the project. If you need a custom name for the
core, you can set:
```yaml
attribute('services.solr.environment.SOLR_CORE_NAME'): example_core_name
```

If you have a pre-existing configuration that should be applied when creating this core, you can configure it like so,
with a path relative to the project root:
```yaml
attribute('services.solr.config_path'): path/to/config/directory/
```

There is a special case if the version required is v4, which is not present on the officially supported versions list.
It's not recommended to use this version as it is unmaintained, but there are some large cloud providers that do not
support newer versions.

To support v4, we build a custom docker image based on the official v5 image, and overwrite the solr installation with
the unsupported version.

## Use twig temples
When overriding harness files or adding application overlay files using twig templates can be valuable for providing access to Workspace attributes. Not only this but you will have the power of [twig] at your fingertips.

To use a twig template there are 2 key steps;
* First create your file and append `.twig` to the filename.
* Second, register your file within `confd.yml` to be compiled by the twig render method.

Let's work through an example for adding drush aliases based on a list of multi-site domains.  
Keep in mind that in `workspace.yml` we have defined our hostnames as follows:
```yaml
attribute('hostname_aliases'):
  - site-one-projectname
  - site-two-projectname
  - site-three-projectname
```

### Create the template file
First off we want to create our new file, `ws.site.yml.twig`. The goal is for this to be compiled to `ws.site.yml`

Create the new file in `tools/workspace/application/overlay/docroot/drush/sites/` with the following contents:
```twig
{%- set sites = @('hostname_aliases')|map(alias => {hostname: alias, name: alias[5:]}) -%}

{% for site in sites %}
{{ site.name }}:
  root: /app/{{ @('drupal.docroot') }}
  uri: https://{{ site.hostname }}.my127.site
{% endfor %}
```
Notice the syntax to reference Workspace attributes: `@('<attribute.name>')`

### Register the new template
Now the file exists, but it won't be compiled until it has been registered. This is done in `confd.yml`.  
More information on the `confd` type can be found [here](https://github.com/my127/workspace/blob/0.1.x/docs/types/confd.md)

To update the file we will need to override the defaults.  
Create the `confd` override in following folder structure:
```
tools/workspace/harness/config/confd.yml
```

Make sure you copy the default configuration from the relevant harness.   
The Drupal 8 defaults can be found [here](../../harness/config/confd.yml)

Adding the new file path will look like this:
```yaml
confd('harness:/'):
  ...existing files...
  # Custom templates
  - { src: application/overlay/docroot/drush/sites/ws.site.yml }
```
