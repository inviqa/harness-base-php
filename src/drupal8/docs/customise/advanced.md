# Advanced customisation

There may be times when you need to customise the Workspace environment beyond what is capable via attribute overrides.  
 
 In these situations, if the customisation can be generalised then please look at the [contributing guide] on how to make the feature available for all projects. 

* Adding new service/container
* Backend.init.steps
* Overriding tasks
