# Drupal 8.x Harness for [Workspace]


## Pre-requisites 
Install [Workspace] or ensure that you have the latest version. Follow the instructions in the project README. 


## Install Guides
* [New project](docs/install/new-project.md)
* [Existing project](docs/install/existing-project.md)
* [Multi-site project](docs/install/multi-site.md)


## Customising the Workspace environment

* [Override the Drupal install steps](docs/customise/install-steps.md)
* [Add custom commands](docs/customise/commands.md)
* [Add/configure services]()
* [Advanced customisation]()


## Contributing back
If there is any customisation required that is relevant to all Drupal 8 projects then ideally these changes should be made to the harness rather than being added as overrides on each project.

See the [guide to contributing](docs/contribute.md)
